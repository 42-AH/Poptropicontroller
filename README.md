## Recommended keybinds

### Left Trigger
Movement mode: restricts the mouse to a circle around the center of the character. Ideal for movement, not for interacting with objects or other characters.

### Right Trigger
Stop: stops the whole controller window.

### A or O
Jump: A simple straight up jump. Use normal jump for parkour.

### X or Triangle
Click: Simply clicks. Best used outside of movement mode, for interactions.

### Other
Feel free to change any other variable, these are just the ones that work best for me.

## MAKE SURE YOUR POPTROPICA WINDOW IS CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR MONITOR
